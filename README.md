# MiniGolf Simulator

This project is my personal learning space for building a functional online enabled game in the bevy engine. It is a work-in-progress where I experiment and build knowledge.

Deeply inspired by 3-D Ultra Minigolf from the late nineties.
    - Thanks Dad for letting me hog your PC endlessly to put balls in holes.
